# Plasmon ID
In the silver nanowires there have been two main absorption peaks(longitudinal and transverse peaks) of interest where some groups determined the longitudinal peak to peak to be plasmonic, others claimed only the transverse was plasmonic, and some just called both of them plasmonic.
The goal of this project is to categorize optically allowed excited states that make up the longitudinal and transverse peaks as plasmon-like or not, using [analytical methods](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b10569) developed by my advisor and co-workers.

Below in part a) is the total absorption spectra and the absorption spectra scaled by the superatomic character of each excited state that contributes to the absorption spectra. 

Part b) is the "Plasmon ID" plot and displays 
- Energy(x-axis)
- Oscillator Strength(y-axis)
- Dipole additivity(point color, based on the color bar on right)
- Collectivity(point size, reference inside plot area)
- Superatomic character(SAC)(circle if > 0.7, unfilled square if 0.25<SAC<0.7, a cross if SAC<0.25)
